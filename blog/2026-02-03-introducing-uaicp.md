# Introducing UAICP: Reliability Contract for Agentic Workflows

UAICP defines a practical, open reliability contract for agentic workflow execution.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why this matters

Tool-enabled agents are useful but operationally fragile when controls are optional.

UAICP focuses on enforceable reliability rules:

- evidence-gated delivery
- machine-verifiable checks
- policy-gated write actions
- fail-safe uncertainty when checks are unmet

## What UAICP is

UAICP is an open protocol contract and reference implementation effort.

It is designed to be embedded under existing orchestrators rather than replace them.

## What comes next

- stabilize v0.1 specification and schemas
- expand conformance tests
- publish adapter examples for major frameworks
