# Framework Adapters

UAICP adapters bridge framework-native workflows to UAICP contracts.

## Required Adapter Functions

- request mapping
- tool result normalization
- verifier invocation
- audit event emission

## Validation Expectation

Adapters should pass UAICP conformance checks for:

- state transitions
- evidence gating
- verification gating
- policy enforcement
