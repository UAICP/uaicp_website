# Integration Overview

UAICP integrates as a reliability control layer under your existing orchestration runtime.

This website provides complete integration guidance. Ongoing enhancements are tracked in GitHub roadmap issues, not hidden in partial docs.

## Integration Target

You keep your existing framework for orchestration and tool execution.

UAICP adds deterministic gates for:

1. identity validation
2. evidence gating
3. verification gating
4. policy-gated write actions
5. replayable audit context

## Canonical Integration Flow

```text
framework request/context
  -> map to UAICP envelope
  -> execute tools and collect evidence objects
  -> run verifier checks
  -> run policy gate (especially for write actions)
  -> deliver OR fail_safe
```

## Reference Implementation Link

Use the concrete finance comparison implementation:

- source: `https://github.com/UAICP/uaicp-reference-impl/blob/main/src/examples/finance/workflow-comparison.ts`
- runner: `https://github.com/UAICP/uaicp-reference-impl/blob/main/src/examples/finance/run-comparison.ts`

Run locally:

```bash
cd uaicp-reference-impl
npm install
npm run example:finance
```

## Definition of Complete Adapter Integration

An adapter is complete when it can:

- map framework state to UAICP envelope fields
- persist required evidence objects before delivery
- block delivery on failed verification or missing evidence
- enforce policy gate semantics on high-risk writes
- emit reason-coded outcomes (`allow`, `deny`, `needs_review`)

## Roadmap Tracking

Roadmap and open enhancements are tracked in:

- specification roadmap tracker: `https://github.com/UAICP/uaicp_specification/issues/16`
- reference implementation issues: `https://github.com/UAICP/uaicp-reference-impl/issues`
