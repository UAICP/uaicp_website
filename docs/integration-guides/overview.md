UAICP is designed to sit beneath existing orchestrators.

## Integration Pattern

1. map framework context into UAICP envelope
2. normalize tool outputs as evidence objects
3. run verifier checks before delivery
4. enforce policy gates for writes

## Benefits

- keeps your existing framework
- adds deterministic reliability controls
- improves auditability and replay capability
