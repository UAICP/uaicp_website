# Use Cases

UAICP is designed for workflows where incorrect delivery or uncontrolled writes are high impact.

## Primary Use Cases

- regulated finance operations with high-risk write actions
- compliance-sensitive data operations requiring replayable audit traces
- enterprise agent workflows that must fail safe under uncertainty

It shows the same workflow implemented as:

1. manual workflow
2. framework-level agentic workflow
3. agent implementation without UAICP gates
4. agent implementation with UAICP gates
