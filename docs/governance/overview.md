# UAICP Governance Overview

The Universal AI Communication Protocol (UAICP) is governed as an open standard under the stewardship of the AI Interoperability Foundation, with transparent, community-driven processes.

## üéØ Mission & Vision

### Mission
To create and maintain an open, universal standard for AI system communication that enables seamless interoperability across the entire AI ecosystem.

### Vision
A future where AI systems can communicate and collaborate regardless of their underlying protocols, providers, or architectures.

## üèõÔ∏è Governance Structure

### AI Interoperability Foundation
The **AI Interoperability Foundation** is the legal entity that stewards the UAICP specification and ecosystem.

**Responsibilities:**
- Maintain the official UAICP specification
- Oversee the technical development process
- Ensure intellectual property policies are followed
- Coordinate with the broader AI community

### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
The **Technical Steering Committee** provides technical oversight and direction for UAICP development.

**Current Focus Areas:**
- Core specification development
- Reference implementation quality
- Integration with major AI protocols
- Community technical support

*Note: The TSC is currently being formed. Details will be available soon.*

### Working Groups
Specialized working groups focus on specific aspects of UAICP:

#### Core Protocol Working Group
- Specification development and refinement
- Protocol design and architecture decisions
- Compatibility and versioning policies

#### Security Working Group
- Security framework development
- Threat modeling and mitigation
- Compliance and certification standards

#### Integration Working Group
- Protocol adapter development
- Platform integration guidelines
- Testing and validation frameworks

## üìã Decision-Making Process

### 1. Community Discussion
- All major changes begin with community discussion
- GitHub Discussions and Issues are primary venues
- Technical proposals are documented and shared

### 2. Technical Review
- Working groups review proposals for technical feasibility
- Implementation impacts are assessed
- Community feedback is incorporated

### 3. TSC Approval
- Major specification changes require TSC approval
- Consensus-based decision making
- Public voting records for transparency

### 4. Community Ratification
- Significant changes undergo public comment period
- Community concerns are addressed
- Final approval incorporates all feedback

## üîÑ Development Process

### Specification Updates
1. **Proposal** - RFC process for major changes
2. **Discussion** - Community review and feedback
3. **Implementation** - Reference implementation development
4. **Testing** - Comprehensive testing and validation
5. **Release** - Official specification update

### Version Management
- **Semantic Versioning** (major.minor.patch)
- **Backwards Compatibility** - Breaking changes only in major versions
- **Deprecation Policy** - Clear migration paths for deprecated features

## ü§ù Community Participation

- **Foundation Oversight**: Legal or policy conflicts handled by Foundation

## üîç Transparency & Accountability

### Public Records
- All TSC meetings have public minutes
- Decision rationales are documented
- Voting records are maintained
- Financial information is disclosed annually

### Regular Reporting

- **Annual Community Survey**: Gather feedback on governance effectiveness
- **Public Roadmap**: Transparent planning and priority setting

### Open Communication
- **Public Mailing Lists**: Key discussions archived publicly
- **Live Streaming**: Important meetings broadcast when possible
- **Documentation**: All processes and policies publicly documented

## üóìÔ∏è Current Priorities

### 2025 Focus Areas
1. **Establish TSC**: Form initial Technical Steering Committee
2. **Core Specification**: Finalize v1.0 specification
3. **Reference Implementations**: Complete initial implementation set
4. **Major Integrations**: MCP, OpenAI, and A2A protocol bridges
5. **Community Growth**: Expand contributor base and adoption

### Upcoming Milestones
