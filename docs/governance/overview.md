# Governance Overview

UAICP is maintained as an open-source protocol project with practical reliability goals.

## Governance Principles

- protocol neutrality
- compatibility-aware changes
- transparent decision records
- measurable conformance outcomes

## Governance Boundary

UAICP governs protocol behavior and conformance contracts.

UAICP does not govern:

- product-specific orchestration design
- framework selection choices
- commercial implementation services

## Change Policy

Contract changes require synchronized updates across:

- spec text
- schema files
- conformance tests

## Decision Workflow

1. open issue with clear problem statement and acceptance criteria
2. propose protocol or schema changes
3. review for compatibility and conformance impact
4. merge with migration notes when applicable
