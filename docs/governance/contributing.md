# Contributing

## How to Contribute

1. open an issue with proposed change
2. reference impacted invariant(s)
3. update docs/schemas/tests together
4. submit PR with validation notes

## Workstreams

Choose issues by workstream labels:

- `workstream/spec`
- `workstream/schema`
- `workstream/conformance`
- `workstream/adapters`
- `workstream/docs`

Use `good first issue` for onboarding tasks and `roadmap` for milestone-critical items.

## Contribution Standards

- avoid unverifiable normative claims
- preserve backward compatibility where possible
- include migration notes for breaking changes

## Local Private Notes

Use `.private/` in each UAICP repository for local-only notes and drafts that should not be committed publicly.
