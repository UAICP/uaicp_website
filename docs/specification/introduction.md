# Introduction to UAICP

UAICP is the **Universal Agent Integrity & Control Protocol**.

UAICP defines a reliability contract for agentic workflows so systems are:

- evidence-gated
- verification-driven
- policy-controlled
- auditable

UAICP is framework-neutral and model-neutral.

## What UAICP Is

- a protocol contract for reliable orchestration
- schemas for envelope, evidence, and verification outputs
- conformance expectations for runtime behavior
- a decoupled reliability layer that sits under existing frameworks

## What UAICP Is Not

- a replacement for existing agent frameworks
- a model provider
- a promise of autonomous correctness without verification

## Operational Risk Coverage

UAICP addresses production risks that become acute in regulated and high-impact workflows:

- no silent hallucination in final outputs
- no unverified delivery when evidence is missing
- no high-risk write action without policy and approval requirements
- no black-box execution without replayable audit context

## Core Reliability Outcome

UAICP systems must produce outputs that are either:

- **correct**, with required evidence and verification, or
- **explicitly uncertain**, with reason codes and no unsafe side effects
