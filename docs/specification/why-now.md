# Why Now

Agentic workflows are increasingly executing real tasks with side effects.

Without deterministic guardrails, common failures include:

- unverified claims
- skipped tool calls
- unauthorized writes
- poor auditability

UAICP standardizes the reliability controls needed to make these workflows production-safe.

## First Principles

- LLM output is probabilistic.
- Workflow control must be deterministic.
- Verification must be mechanical, not self-assessed.

UAICP operationalizes these principles through contracts and invariants.
