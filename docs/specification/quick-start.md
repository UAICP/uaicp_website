# Quick Start

## 1. Read the Contract

Start with the core specification:

- `specification/introduction`
- `specification/specification`

## 2. Implement Envelope + Evidence

Adopt the UAICP schemas in your orchestrator runtime:

- message envelope
- evidence object
- verification report

## 3. Wire Invariants

Before final output, enforce:

- required evidence exists
- required verification checks pass
- write policy gates are satisfied

## 4. Integrate an Adapter

Use an adapter pattern for your framework:

- LangGraph
- AutoGen
- CrewAI
- OpenAI Agents SDK

## 5. Run Conformance

Evaluate against baseline compliance checks and produce a report artifact.
